		<h2>COCO</h2>
	  <section class="proj-desc">
			<p>As our term project for IAT 343: Animation, my team and I (5 members total) modelled, animated, and edited together Coco, a short film about a curious coconut who leaves his home tree to explore the mysterious island around him. The project was completed using AutoDesk MAYA, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe AfterEffects.</p>

		<h3>IDEATION</h3>
    <p>We began by individually writing a few short story prompts. When we met again, we discussed our story prompts, and began the selection process with consideration to the 11-week deadline, our skillsets, and overall desired outcome. We chose a story about a curious coconut because we felt the 3D-modelling and animation was feasible, and because the island setting would lend itself to an interesting colour palette and style. From there, we began discussing storytelling techniques, particularly how to add intrigue through foreshadowing.</p>

		<h3>ART DIRECTION</h3>
    <p>From there, we began detailing our goals in terms of visuals. Inspired by The Wizard’s Fantasy, we wanted to see how we could attain more painterly backgrounds. From there, we created a storyboard of colour inspirations. Additionally, myself and a teammate, Kristina, created some basic iterations of Coco’s design, as well as some backgrounds and objects.</p>

		<h3>STORYBOARDS</h3>
    <p>We quickly moved into creating documents for planning, including a more precise script and a storyboard video. In retrospect, I feel we should have invested more into planning the various scenes and framing them. A major point we overlooked was that 3D animation requires deeper consideration to object positions and relations to each other.</p>

		<h3>ANIMATIC</h3>
    <p>For the next few weeks, we divided and individually modelled the various objects for our animation, including things such as shells, trees, cups, chairs, buildings, and various other beach island-themed objects. From there, we divided specific scenes amongst us. After animating particular scenes and objects, we combined our parts. I was largely responsible for re-animating and connecting scenes s needed, setting up objects in relation to each other, and basic rendering through playblasts for editing into the animatic. The playblasted renders were edited together into an animatic alongside narration, with storyboard frames filling in any gaps.</p></section>

		<h3>FINAL DELIVERABLE</h3>
		<p>Moving into the latter stages of the project, we set up a full environment which would help deal with our previous issues of when particular objects would be seen. From there, we divided scenes again and redid Coco’s movements through the scenes. As we finished, I added in the camera movements and we began the rendering process. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our campus closed down and we no longer had access to SFU’s computers for mass-rendering. For this reason, we chose to render in a lower resolution rather than use playblasts so we could still convey the visual appearance we had wanted from the beginning. Though we had many roadbumps in terms of organizing, planning, and communication, I am still immensely proud of the work put into “Coco” and the final result.</p>
