		<h2>COCO</h2>
		<section class="proj-desc">
			<p>As our term project for IAT 343: Animation, my team and I modelled, animated, and edited together Coco, a short film about a curious coconut who leaves his home tree to explore the mysterious island around him. The project was completed using AutoDesk MAYA, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe AfterEffects. Though we shared different roles throughout the process such as modelling objects and rendering scenes, I was largely responsible for setting and animating cameras for the later stages of the project. Completing this project gave me insight into the animation and film-making process, and allowed me to recognize how essential it is to plan far, far ahead, and to document communication and ensure the whole team is on the same page.</p>

				<h3>IDEATION</h3>
				<p>With consideration to the 11-week deadline, our skillsets, and overall desired outcome, we chose a story about a curious coconut because we felt the 3D-modelling and animation was feasible. We also felt the island setting would lend itself to an interesting colour palette and style. From there, we began discussing storytelling techniques, particularly how to add intrigue through foreshadowing.</p>

				<h3>ART DIRECTION</h3>
				<p>Inspired by <a href="https://vimeo.com/114335518" target="_blank">The Wizard’s Fantasy</a>, we wanted to see how we could attain more painterly backgrounds. From there, we created a storyboard of colour inspirations. Additionally, myself and a teammate, Kristina, created some basic iterations of Coco’s design, as well as some backgrounds and objects.</p>

				<h3>STORYBOARDS</h3>
				<p>We quickly moved into creating documents for planning, including a more precise script and a storyboard video. In retrospect, I feel we should have invested more into planning the various scenes and framing them. A major point we overlooked was that 3D animation requires deeper consideration to how objects are positioned relative to each other, as they may add visual clutter based on the camera angles.</p>

			<section class="grid-content 2b">
				<h3>ANIMATIC</h3>
				<p>For the next few weeks, we divided and individually modelled the various objects for our animation, including things such as shells, trees, cups, chairs, buildings, and various other beach island-themed objects. I modelled some minor objects such as the tables, chairs, cups, coral, and shells. Once my teammates were finished animating Coco into the scenes, I adjusted the animation keyframes as needed to connect scenes, set up objects in relation to each other, and completed the basic rendering through playblasts for editing into the animatic. The basic renders were edited together into an animatic alongside narration, with storyboard frames filling in any gaps.

				<section class="grid-content 2b">
					<h3>FINAL DELIVERABLE</h3>
					<p>Moving into the latter stages of the project, we set up a full environment which would help deal with our previous issues of having to adjust particular objects for different camera angles. From there, we divided scenes again. At this stage, I completed a walk cycle for Coco but we were unable to utilize for all the scenes due to version compatibility issues and time constraints. After my teammates finished animating Coco through the scenes, I added in the cameras, animated their movements through the scene and adjusted keyframe animations for objects in order to improve the speed and flow through the story. Then, we began the rendering process. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our campus closed down and we no longer had access to SFU’s computers for mass-rendering. For this reason, we chose to render in a lower resolution rather than use playblasts so we could still showcase the visual appearance and texturing we had wanted from the beginning.</p>
