		<h2>NOTETEACHER</h2>
		<section class="proj-desc">
			<p>For IAT 267, my team and I were tasking with creating an interactive system using sensors, an Arduino microcontroller and Processing for programming. As I was responsible for majority of the programming while iterating our prototypes, I was able to develop my programming competency and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I learned how to assess the skillsets of my team in order to set milestones and meet deadlines.</p>

				<h3>IDEATION</h3>
				<p>Based on the assignment brief and suggested topics, we ideated on possible projects. We decided to emulate a sort of MIDI device, designed to teach children various sounds based on an environment sensor. We planned to use 12 touch sensors, as well as two potentiometers.</p>

				<figure class="grid-content 2a"><img src="img/nt_milestone1.png" alt="Diagram of our first milestone setup, with one sensor connected to the processing interface via the Arduino microcontroller."></figure>

				<section class="grid-content 2b">
					<h4>MILESTONE 1</h4>
					<p>Our first milestone was to successfully use a touch sensor to trigger both a sound, using the Minim library, as well as an interface change in Processing. The biggest challenge at this stage was to successfully communicate between the circuitry and Processing, which we were able to achieve by referencing and experimenting with both course and external materials.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<!-- SECOND MILESTONE -->
			<section class="grid-container">
				<figure class="grid-content 2a"><img src="img/nt_milestone2.png" alt="Diagram of our second milestone setup, with three sensors connected to the processing interface via the Arduino microcontroller."></figure>
				<section class="grid-content 2b">
					<h4>MILESTONE 2</h4>
					<p>Our next milestone was to successfully expand our system to three sensors, each of which would prompt a different sound and interface change. The main concern at this stage was maintaining our circuitry to avoid confusion.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<!-- THIRD MILESTONE -->
			<section class="grid-container">
				<figure class="grid-content 2a"><img src="img/nt_milestone3.png" alt="Diagram of our second milestone setup, with fours sensors connected to the processing interface via the Arduino microcontroller."></figure>
				<section class="grid-content 2b">
					<h4>MILESTONE 3</h4>
					<p>The next milestone, and final major milestone before expanding to our full set of sensors was to incorporate one of our potentiometers, and to map its value to a variable in Processing. Based on the value, the system would switch to one of three instrument modes. This required more careful consideration to the wiring to the Arduino microcontroller as we were now dealing with both analog and digital sensors.</p>

		<!-- FINAL DELIVERABLE -->
		<section id="final" class="grid-container">
			<figure class="grid-content 2a"><img src="img/nt_milestone4.png" alt="Diagram of our final deliverable setup, with twelve sensors connected to the processing interface via the Arduino microcontroller."></figure>
			<section class="grid-content 2b">
				<h3>FINAL DELIVERABLE</h3>
				<p>As we already knew we had the capability to add potentiometers, we chose to add our second potentiometer at the last stage. For this potentiometer, the value was mapped to a 100 scale for the volume of the device, which then changed the corresponding volume slider on the interface. In order to expand to 12 touch sensors successfully, as well as to add our potentiometers, we needed to clearly mark and organize our circuits and wires, as well as create a body for the system. As one of our final steps, we also finalized our interface design at this stage.</p>
